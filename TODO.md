# Distribution
At the moment, I make the npm packages by hand.
I should set up a script.

# Documentation
Definitely.

# Integration tests
There are no tests as yet to see everything works together.
In particular, the code generated by the babel plugin hasn’t
been checked to work with thea.

# Performance
For a library that is supposed to be performant, it’s pretty
poor not to have checked performance yet!
